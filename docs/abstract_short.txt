We consider the problem of solving systems of ordinary differential equations in exact real arithmetic, i.e., in the sense of arbitrarily precise numerical computations.
It is known from real complexity theory that this problem is PSPACE-hard in the general case.
However, when restricting the right hand side functions of the system to be not only polynomial time computable but also analytic, the solutions will again be polynomial time computable and analytic.
By carefully choosing the representation, this result can even be turned into uniform algorithms on analytic functions.
We present a practical implementation of such a solver in the C++ programming language based on the iRRAM library for exact real arithmetic.
To that end, we also give a representation for multidimensional analytic functions in terms of an abstract data type and an implementation of such a type.
Different algorithms are evaluated from a practical point of view and compared with complexity bounds known from theory.
